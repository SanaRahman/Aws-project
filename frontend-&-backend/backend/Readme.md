# EcoTravel Carbon Calculator


The EcoTravel Carbon Calculator
 is a Flask-based web application that calculates carbon emissions for different modes of transportation and allows users to explore eco-friendly alternatives. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store vehicle emission data and user progress information.

## Features

- Calculate carbon emissions for car, bus, and shuttle travel options.
- Explore eco-friendly alternatives based on user input.
- Store and track user progress in reducing carbon emissions.
- Retrieve and display user progress data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python and Flask (for running the web application).
- PostgreSQL (for the database).
- psycopg2 (Python PostgreSQL adapter).
- dotenv (for environment variable management).
- Node.js and npm (for the frontend, if applicable).

## Installation and Setup
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install Python dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the `.env` file with the database credentials.

7. Run the Flask application:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

8. If you have a frontend (React or similar), make sure to set it up separately and update the frontend code accordingly.

## Usage

- Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` (or a different port as specified).

- Use the web interface to calculate carbon emissions for different travel options and explore eco-friendly alternatives.

- To view user progress, access the appropriate endpoint or feature provided by your frontend application.

## Database Setup

The application uses PostgreSQL as the database. You can set up the database schema and populate it with initial data by running the `create_table_and_populate` function in `app.py`.
